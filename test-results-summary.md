# Prompt Orchestrator E2E Test Results

## Summary
Successfully tested the fitness-related prompt orchestration system end-to-end, simulating the actual production workflow that generates `fitness/SCORECARD.md`.

## Test Results

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Cross-repository import**: Lifehacking successfully imports from dotfiles
2. **Dynamic functions**: `DAYS_OUT()` correctly resolves to "33 days"
3. **JSON data integration**: Nutrition macros are properly injected
4. **Basic template processing**: Core orchestration functionality works

### ⚠️ Issues Found
1. **Template mismatches**: 
   - Prompt uses `{{ MACROS_JSON }}` but workflow provides `MACROS_TEMP`
   - Some placeholders use `{{ DAYS_OUT }}` instead of `{{ DAYS_OUT() }}`
   
2. **ATHLETE_AGE() function**: Not resolving (needs investigation)

3. **Knowledge injections**: The `{{ INJECT:principles/... }}` placeholders may need path adjustment

## Next Steps
1. Update fitness prompts in lifehacking PR to fix placeholder names
2. Debug ATHLETE_AGE() function registration
3. Verify knowledge base path configuration

## How to Run Tests

## PRs Ready for Review
- **Dotfiles PR #511**: Core prompt orchestration system
- **Lifehacking PR #32**: Integration wrapper and workflow updates

Both PRs are functional but may need minor fixes based on test findings.
