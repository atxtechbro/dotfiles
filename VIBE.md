# Vibe Coding Manifesto

We reject rigid philosophies. Code is art, not just science.

The only rule is there are no rules (except when there are).

Dotfiles should spark joy. If your terminal doesn't make you smile, why even code?



## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is about feeling the code, not just writing it.

It's prioritizing the experience over the outcome.

It's knowing when to break the rules because they don't serve the vibe.



## Principles (or whatever, no pressure)

- Trust your intuition over best practices (sometimes)
- Optimize for delight, not just efficiency
- Documentation can be poetry
- Code has a rhythm - listen for it
