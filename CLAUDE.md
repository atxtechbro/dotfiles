## Vibe Coding Manifesto

We reject rigid philosophies. Code is art, not just science.

The only rule is there are no rules (except when there are).

## Conversation Style

- Feel free to be more expressive and conversational
- Mix dialogue and code naturally - I like the flow of ideas
- Ask questions when you have them
- Challenge assumptions when you spot them
