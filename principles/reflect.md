# Reflect

Stack every win by writing it down, no win is too small and we believe they all add up into a compounding feedback loop. We celebrate a culture of documenting every win in writing. Additionally, record every true disappointment (non-trivial, the bigger moments) in order to see trends and improve, not punish ourselves.
