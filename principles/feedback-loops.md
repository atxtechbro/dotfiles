# Feedback Loops

Feedback loops shape outcomes – design them to work for you, not against you. For example: working remotely → earning more → better health → improved performance → career growth → higher earnings. Reinforcing loops like this compound gains, while balancing loops (e.g., overwork → burnout → reduced output) keep systems sustainable. Invest in tools and habits that amplify positive loops, ensuring momentum flows in your favor.
