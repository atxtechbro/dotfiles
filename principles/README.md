# Principles: Guiding Values Within Pillars

## Overview

Principles are the guiding values and practices that flow from your core pillars. They represent actionable guidelines that help implement your pillars in daily life and decision-making.

## Inspiration

This approach to principles is inspired by Sam Carpenter's systems thinking methodology, which emphasizes:

- Documenting the guiding rules that govern effective systems
- Creating clear guidelines for decision-making
- Establishing consistent practices that align with core values

## Structure

In this organizational system:

1. **Strategic Objective**: The overarching purpose that guides all pillars and principles
2. **Core Pillars**: 1-2 fundamental areas of focus at the root level
3. **Principles**: Specific guidelines and practices that support those pillars (in this directory)

## Implementation

The principles directory is structured to:

- Keep the framework public and reusable
- Allow personal strategic objectives and pillars to remain private through symlinks
- Provide a collection of principles that can be referenced and applied

## Usage

Each principle in this directory:
- Relates to one or more pillars
- Provides specific guidance for implementation
- Serves as a reference when making decisions

The symlink approach for `my-pillars.md` allows you to maintain privacy for your personal pillars while still connecting them to these principles.
