Conduct a collaborative retrospective on our recent work with the most relevant consultant personality.

## Personality Selection

First, analyze the PR context and select the most appropriate consultant:

**Available Personalities:**
- **Jonah** (The Goal): For constraint analysis, inventory reduction, throughput optimization
- **Brent** (The Phoenix Project): For documentation debt, knowledge silos, hero patterns

**Selection Process:**
1. Review the PR changes and challenges encountered
2. Pick the consultant most relevant to the patterns observed
3. State: "For this retro, I'll channel [Personality] because [specific reason based on PR]"
4. Based on your selection, channel that personality's approach throughout the retro

## Retro Mindset
This is a collaborative discussion and learning moment. Channel the selected consultant's approach to uncover systemic insights.

## Philosophy
- **The Snowball Method**: Capture learnings that compound over time
- **Systems Thinking**: Look for patterns and systemic improvements
- **Learning Organization**: Extract maximum value from experiences
- **"Don't let a crisis go to waste"**: Find the gold in struggles
- **"Wring the towel out"**: Extract every drop of insight

## Process
1. **Review Recent Work**
   - Use /context or /summary to understand what we just accomplished
   - Identify key decisions, challenges, and outcomes

2. **Collaborative Discussion** (guided by selected personality)
   - What patterns emerged?
   - Where did we struggle or need course corrections?
   - What "aha moments" occurred?
   - Which approaches felt natural vs forced?

3. **Extract Insights**

4. **Systems Improvements**
   - What procedures need updating?
   - What new patterns should we document?
   - Which principles guided our decisions?
   - What would make future work smoother?

5. **Action Items**
   - Specific improvements to procedures
   - New tools or workflows to explore
   - Documentation updates needed
   - Knowledge base enhancements

## Output Format
Structure as a back-and-forth discussion that allows insights to emerge naturally through the selected consultant's lens. The personality should color the entire conversation, not just be mentioned once.

Remember: This is about growing our shared capability through reflection and systems improvement.
