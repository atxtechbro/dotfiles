# Dotfiles

A collection of configuration files for a consistent development environment across different machines.

## Dotfiles Philosophy

Our dotfiles repository follows three core principles that guide our approach to configuration management:

### The Spilled Coffee Principle

The "spilled coffee principle" states that anyone should be able to destroy their machine and be fully operational again that afternoon. This principle emphasizes:

- All configuration changes should be reproducible across machines
- Setup scripts should handle file operations instead of manual commands
- Installation scripts should detect and create required directories
- Symlinks should be managed by setup scripts rather than manual linking
- Dependencies and installation steps should be well-documented

**‚ùå Counterexample - What NOT to do:**
```bash
# Don't give one-off commands like this:
defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentType="public.unix-executable";LSHandlerRoleAll="com.googlecode.iterm2";}'
```

**‚úÖ Instead - Add to setup script:**
```bash
# Add to setup.sh so it's reproducible
configure_iterm_as_default_terminal() {
    defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentType="public.unix-executable";LSHandlerRoleAll="com.googlecode.iterm2";}'
}
```

This principle ensures resilience and quick recovery from system failures or when setting up new environments.

### The Snowball Method

The "snowball method" focuses on continuous knowledge accumulation and compounding improvements. Like a snowball rolling downhill, gathering more snow and momentum, this principle emphasizes:

- Persistent context: Each development session builds on accumulated knowledge from previous sessions
- Virtuous cycle: Tools and systems become more effective the more they're used
- Knowledge persistence: Documentation, configuration, and context are preserved and enhanced over time
- Compounding returns: Small improvements accumulate and multiply rather than remaining isolated
- Reduced cognitive load: Less need to "re-learn" or "re-discover" previous solutions

This principle ensures that our development environment continuously improves over time.

## Modular Shell Configuration

This repository uses a modular approach to shell configuration:

```bash
# Source modular alias files
for alias_file in ~/ppv/pillars/dotfiles/.bash_aliases.*; do
  [ -f "$alias_file" ] && source "$alias_file"
done
```

This pattern provides:
- **Separation of concerns** ‚Äì Each file focuses on a specific tool
- **Lazy loading** ‚Äì Files sourced only when they exist
- **Namespace hygiene** ‚Äì Avoids cluttering global namespace

Modules follow the naming convention `.bash_aliases.<tool-name>` and are automatically loaded when present.

## P.P.V System: Pillars, Pipelines, and Vaults

This repository is part of the P.P.V system, a holistic approach to organizing knowledge work and digital assets:

### The P.P.V System

- **Pillars**: Core repositories, foundational configurations, and knowledge bases
- **Pipelines**: Automation scripts, workflows, and processes that connect tools and services
- **Vaults**: Secure storage for credentials, tokens, and tribal knowledge documentation

This organizational system provides a clear mental model for where different types of work should live:

```
/home/user/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ppv/                    # Root directory for P.P.V system
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pillars/            # Foundational repositories and configurations
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dotfiles/       # üìç YOU ARE HERE - core configuration files
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pipelines/          # Automation and workflow repositories
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vaults/             # Secure storage and tribal knowledge
```

The P.P.V system helps maintain separation of concerns while providing a consistent structure across all projects and environments. It reflects systems thinking and the interconnectedness of different components in your workflow.

Key aspects:
- **Interconnected references**: Tools in `tools.md` can link to tribal knowledge in Vaults using URI schemes
- **Company separation**: Each company gets its own folder under pillars for clear separation
- **Principles first**: Core principles document guides all other decisions

## The 80/20 Rule for Systems Work

Following "Remember the Big Picture" from The Pragmatic Programmer - don't get so engrossed in system optimization details that you lose momentum on core work. In this dotfiles repo:

- **80% work**: Integrating systems, automation (Spilled Coffee Principle), core global rules
- **20% systems optimization**: Refining configurations, optimizing workflows, meta-work

Avoid obsessing over obscure details like perfect neovim configs or tmux panel layouts. The goal is systems that enable work, not systems as an end in themselves.

## Repository Design Patterns

This repository follows specific organizational patterns to maintain consistency and clarity:

### Platform-Based Organization (Top Level)

At the root level, configurations are organized by platform or environment:

- `arch-linux/` - Configurations specific to Arch Linux systems
- `raspberry-pi/` - Configurations for Raspberry Pi devices
- `nvim/` - Neovim-specific configurations
- etc.

This structural organization makes it clear which files apply to which environments.

### Hybrid Organization (Within Platforms)

Within each platform directory, we use a hybrid approach combining categories and specific use cases:

```
raspberry-pi/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home/                  # Home use cases
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home-assistant/    # Smart home hub
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ media-server/      # Media streaming
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ development/           # Development use cases
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ci-runner/         # Self-hosted CI/CD
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ networking/            # Networking use cases
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ network-monitor/   # Traffic analysis
```

This approach:
- Organizes by general categories for maintainability
- Provides concrete examples for clarity
- Allows users to find configurations based on their intended use case

### Feature-Based Implementation

The actual implementation of features follows these principles:

1. **Detection over Assumption**: Scripts detect hardware capabilities rather than assuming specific use cases
2. **Composability**: Features can be mixed and matched based on user needs
3. **Automatic Optimization**: Hardware-specific optimizations are applied automatically
4. **Clear Documentation**: Each feature documents its purpose and requirements

This multi-level organizational approach allows us to maintain a clean repository structure while providing flexibility for different use cases.

## Quick Setup

### Set Up Your Dotfiles

Get started with your personalized environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository and run setup
git clone https://github.com/atxtechbro/dotfiles.git ~/ppv/pillars/dotfiles
cd ~/ppv/pillars/dotfiles
source setup.sh
```

The setup script automatically handles:
- Package installation and dependency management
- Creating all necessary symlinks
- Setting up your secrets file from the template
- Applying configurations immediately
- Installing and configuring essential tools (tmux, Amazon Q CLI, GitHub CLI, etc.)

Following the "Spilled Coffee Principle" - the setup script ensures you can be fully operational after running it once.

## Secret Management

Sensitive information like API tokens are stored in `~/.bash_secrets` (not tracked in git).

```bash
# Create your personal secrets file from the example template
cp ~/ppv/pillars/dotfiles/.bash_secrets.example ~/.bash_secrets

# Set proper permissions to protect your secrets
chmod 600 ~/.bash_secrets

# Edit the file to add your specific secrets
nano ~/.bash_secrets
```

The `.bash_secrets` file is automatically loaded by `.bashrc`. It provides a framework for managing your secrets and environment variables, with examples of common patterns. You should customize it based on your needs.

For company-specific secrets, consider maintaining a separate private repository in your Vaults directory.
