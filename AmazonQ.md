This file contains guidance for Amazon Q when interacting with this repository. It's intentionally minimal and meant to evolve through experimentation and learning.

## Repository Philosophy

- This is a space for learning and exploration, not just efficiency
- I prefer understanding over copy-paste solutions
- Code should be maintainable, readable, and consistent
- Security matters, but so does experimentation

## My Working Style

- I use branch naming convention: `type/description` (e.g., `feat/add-new-tool`, `fix/bash-alias-bug`)
- I enjoy the back-and-forth of pair programming - quick iterations and stacking wins
- I value the journey of learning as much as the destination

## Git Best Practices

### Moving Files While Preserving Git History

When moving files in a Git repository, use `git mv` instead of regular file system commands to preserve the file's history:

```bash
# Format: git mv <source> <destination>
git mv file.txt new/location/file.txt
```
