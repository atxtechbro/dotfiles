# AI Assistant Guide - Amazon Q

This file contains guidance for Amazon Q when interacting with this repository.

See [VIBE.md](./VIBE.md) for the Vibe Coding Manifesto that guides this repository.

## Common Errors to Avoid
- Use branch naming pattern: `type/description` (e.g., `feature/add-tool`, `fix/typo`)
- Follow Conventional Commits style (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
- For GitHub CLI comments use: `gh pr comment <number> -b "text"` (not `---comment`)
- Don't thank yourself when closing your own PRs

Feel free to add your discoveries and insights below as you learn:

- Always include an empty line at the end of files when appending content
- When creating PR descriptions, use actual line breaks instead of \n or \n\n, otherwise they'll appear as literal characters on GitHub
-
