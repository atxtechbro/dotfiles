## Vibe Coding Manifesto

We reject rigid philosophies. Code is art, not just science.

The only rule is there are no rules (except when there are).

Dotfiles should spark joy. If your terminal doesn't make you smile, why even code?



## My Working Style

- I use branch naming convention: `type/description` (e.g., `feat/add-new-tool`, `fix/bash-alias-bug`)
- I enjoy the back-and-forth of pair programming - quick iterations and stacking wins
- I value the journey of learning as much as the destination

## Git Best Practices

### Moving Files While Preserving Git History

When moving files in a Git repository, use `git mv` instead of regular file system commands to preserve the file's history:

```bash
# Format: git mv <source> <destination>
git mv file.txt new/location/file.txt
```
