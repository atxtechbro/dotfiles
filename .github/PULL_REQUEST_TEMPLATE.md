REVIEWER: A developer juggling 6 tmux panes, 17 GitHub issues, and a cold cup of coffee, who likely created this issue 15 minutes ago and will personally consume every change in their dotfiles environment
PHILOSOPHY: Optimize for the human reviewer who is the constraint
GOAL: Make PR review a moment of clarity in the chaos, not another tab to dread

Remember: No emojis in titles, but the body should be vibrant and visually engaging ðŸŽ¯
