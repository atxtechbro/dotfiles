<!-- 
REVIEWER: A developer juggling 6 tmux panes, 17 GitHub issues, and a cold cup of coffee, who likely created this issue 15 minutes ago and will personally consume every change in their dotfiles environment
PHILOSOPHY: Optimize for the human reviewer who is the constraint
GOAL: Make PR review a moment of clarity in the chaos, not another tab to dread

Remember: No emojis in titles, but the body should be vibrant and visually engaging ðŸŽ¯

Note: While this PR may be seen by future readers and AI workflows analyzing patterns from merged PRs, we're NOT optimizing for them. This is about reducing cognitive fatigue and increasing joy for the primary reviewer above.
