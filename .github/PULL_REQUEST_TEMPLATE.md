<!-- 
AUDIENCE: A developer juggling 6 tmux panes, 17 GitHub issues, and a cold cup of coffee
PHILOSOPHY: Based on Developer Experience, PR Readability Contract, and OSE principles
GOAL: Make PR review a moment of clarity in the chaos, not another tab to dread

The AI composing this PR body should follow the PR Readability Contract principle (knowledge/principles/pr-readability-contract.md) - optimize for the human reviewer who is the constraint. Make this the one tab that sparks joy instead of dread.
Remember: No emojis in titles, but the body should be vibrant and visually engaging ðŸŽ¯
