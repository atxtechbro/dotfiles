<!-- 
AUDIENCE: A developer juggling 6 tmux panes, 17 GitHub issues, and a cold cup of coffee
PHILOSOPHY: Based on Developer Experience, PR Readability Contract, and OSE principles
GOAL: Make PR review a moment of clarity in the chaos, not another tab to dread

The AI composing this PR body should consider:
- What would bring joy to read in between context switches?
- What gives maximum control and understanding at a glance?
- What's most digestible while your coffee goes cold?
- How to be that one tab that sparks joy instead of dread?
- Remember: No emojis in titles, but the body should be vibrant and visually engaging ðŸŽ¯
