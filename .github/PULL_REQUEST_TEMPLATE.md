# TITLE GUIDANCE (For Recruiters & Hiring Managers)

NEW AUDIENCE REALITY: PR titles are now micro-resume bullets appearing in:
- GitHub profile activity feeds (what recruiters see first)
- Resume PR links (6-second scan by hiring managers)
- GitHub search results (how your AI/ML work gets discovered)

TITLE PATTERN: type: [action verb] [quantified impact] [technology keywords]

EXAMPLES:
❌ fix: update config
✅ fix: implement triple AI provider redundancy for zero-downtime orchestration

❌ feat: add extract-best-frame command
✅ feat: build Claude-powered video frame selection using AI visual judgment

❌ refactor: improve performance
✅ refactor: optimize MCP server response time by 85% through parallel processing

TECHNOLOGY KEYWORDS FOR AI ROLES:
- AI/ML: Claude, GPT, LLM, embeddings, RAG, agents, orchestration
- Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, terraform, CI/CD
- Data: pipeline, streaming, batch, ETL, real-time
- Scale: parallel, distributed, concurrent, high-throughput

30-SECOND CHECKLIST:
1. Does the title communicate business/technical value?
2. Are relevant technologies mentioned?
3. Is the impact quantified (if measurable)?
4. Would a recruiter understand what was achieved?

# BODY GUIDANCE (For Primary Reviewer - You)

REVIEWER: A developer juggling 6 tmux panes, 17 GitHub issues, and a cold cup of coffee, who likely created this issue 15 minutes ago and will personally consume every change in their dotfiles environment
PHILOSOPHY: Optimize for the human reviewer who is the constraint
GOAL: Make PR review a moment of clarity in the chaos, not another tab to dread

Remember: No emojis in titles, but the body should be vibrant and visually engaging 🎯

Note: Title is for recruiters, body is for you. This separation lets us serve both audiences without compromise.
