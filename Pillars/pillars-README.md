# Core Pillars

## What are Core Pillars?

Core Pillars are the foundational areas of your life that support everything else. They represent your highest priorities and values that guide your decisions and actions.

## Purpose

Well-defined Core Pillars:

- Provide structure and focus to your life system
- Help you prioritize where to invest your time and energy
- Create a framework for organizing your principles
- Serve as a filter for decision-making

## Implementation

In this repository:
- `my-pillars.md` is a symlink to your private implementation
- Your actual pillars remain private while the framework is public
- This implementation favors a focused approach with just 2-3 core pillars
- Designed for a personal filesystem rather than a Notion setup

## Creating Your Own

When creating your own Core Pillars, consider:

1. What are the 2-3 most fundamental areas of your life?
2. What values do you hold most dear?
3. What areas, if neglected, would cause your life to become unbalanced?

Keep your pillars few in number (2-3 is recommended) and broad enough to encompass multiple principles beneath them.

## References & Inspiration

The concept of life pillars draws inspiration from August Bradley's "Pillars, Pipelines & Vaults" (PPV) system, which he implemented in Notion. While this implementation:

- Uses a personal filesystem approach rather than Notion
- Focuses on fewer pillars (2-3 rather than many)
- Integrates with a different overall framework

The core idea that key life areas can serve as organizing pillars remains valuable across different implementations.
