# Pillars Framework

## Overview

The Pillars framework is an organizational system for defining and implementing your core values and guiding principles. Inspired by Sam Carpenter's systems thinking methodology, it provides structure to align actions with values.

## Structure

The Pillars framework consists of:

1. **Strategic Objective**: The overarching purpose that guides everything else
   - Defines your mission and vision
   - Provides context for all pillars and principles
   - Serves as the ultimate "why" behind your system

2. **Core Pillars**: 1-2 fundamental areas of focus
   - Represent your highest-level values
   - Serve as the foundation for all principles
   - Provide clarity for decision-making

3. **Principles**: Specific guidelines and practices
   - Implement the core pillars in practical ways
   - Provide actionable guidance for daily decisions
   - Create consistency in actions and outcomes

## Implementation

This directory contains:

- `strategic-objective.md`: Symlink to your private strategic objective
- `my-pillars.md`: Symlink to your private core pillars
- `principles/`: Directory containing specific principles that flow from the pillars

## Privacy Model

The framework uses symlinks to maintain privacy while sharing the structure:

- The framework and structure are public and reusable
- Your personal strategic objective and pillars remain private
- The symlinks connect your private content to the public framework locally

## Inspiration

This approach is inspired by Sam Carpenter's systems thinking, which emphasizes:

- Documenting the guiding rules that govern effective systems
- Creating clear guidelines for decision-making
- Establishing consistent practices that align with core values
