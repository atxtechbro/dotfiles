# System Review

System reviews are the heartbeat of growth – personally and professionally. Block time weekly to reflect candidly: what worked, what didn't, and what wins stacked up? In teams, lean into the "touchy-feely"; it's where gold hides. Honesty trumps saving face, whether in sprint retrospectives or personal reviews. Stay disciplined: keep sessions focused, regular, and never just go through the motions. This is deep learning time – embrace it, and watch how fun progress becomes when you truly engage.
