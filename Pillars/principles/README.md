Principles are specific guidelines and practices that implement the core pillars in practical ways. They provide actionable guidance for daily decisions and create consistency in actions and outcomes.

## Creating Your Own Principles

To create your own principles:

1. Create a file in your private repository to contain your principles collection
2. Create a symlink from this directory to your private principles file
3. Organize your principles in a way that makes sense for your system

## Relationship to Pillars

Each principle should flow from and support your core pillars. When creating principles, consider:

- How does this principle implement my core pillars?
- Does this principle provide clear, actionable guidance?
- Is this principle memorable and practical?

## Examples of Principles

Principles might include guidelines like:

- "Always document decisions and their context"
- "Measure twice, cut once"
- "Seek feedback early and often"
- "Focus on systems, not goals"
