# Strategic Objective

## What is a Strategic Objective?

The Strategic Objective is a concise, one-page document that provides overall direction for your life and work. It serves as the highest-level guiding document in your personal system.

## Purpose

A well-crafted Strategic Objective:

- Provides a clear direction for all decisions
- Serves as the ultimate "why" behind your actions
- Creates a foundation for your pillars and principles
- Remains relatively stable over time
- Can be referenced when making difficult choices

## Inspiration from "Work the System"

This concept is directly inspired by Sam Carpenter's "Work the System" methodology, where:

> "The Strategic Objective is your Declaration of Independence, your mandate for a better future. The General Operating Principles document is your Constitution, a set of guidelines for future decision making. The Working Procedures are your laws, the rules of your game."

Carpenter emphasizes that:

> "A primary thrust of the Work the System method is to generate extra time so you can better prepare."

And warns that:

> "The largest obstacle to better preparation is the reluctance to invest the necessary time to be better prepared."

## Implementation

In this repository:
- `strategic-objective.md` is a symlink to your private implementation
- Your actual strategic objective remains private while the framework is public
- The strategic objective should be reviewed periodically but changed rarely

## Creating Your Own

When creating your own Strategic Objective, consider:

1. What is your ultimate purpose?
2. What future are you working toward?
3. What values are non-negotiable for you?
4. What would success look like in 5-10 years?

Keep it concise (1-2 paragraphs) and inspirational enough to guide all other elements of your system.
