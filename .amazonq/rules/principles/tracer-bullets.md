# Tracer Bullets Development

Like military tracer rounds that help soldiers catch their target in the dark, each iteration provides immediate feedback to guide the next shot.

- Each cycle/loop/iteration should feel like getting closer
- Commit early and often - each commit is a tracer round  
- Short feedback loops over long planning
- Enables coding in unfamiliar languages through rapid iteration
- AI-human feedback loop is core to this approach
