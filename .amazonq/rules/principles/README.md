# Principles

Foundational truths that guide development across all projects.

- `do-dont-explain.md` - Act like an agent, not a chatbot (with retro exception)
- `invent-and-simplify.md` - Constant reinvention and simplifying assumptions
- `subtraction-creates-value.md` - Strategic removal often creates more value than addition
- `tracer-bullets.md` - Rapid feedback-driven development with ground truth
- `transparency-in-agent-work.md` - Make agent reasoning visible during reviews
- `versioning-mindset.md` - Iteration over reinvention
