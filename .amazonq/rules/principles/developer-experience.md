# Developer Experience (DevEx)

Based on the Third Ideal from The Unicorn Project: "Improvement of Daily Work" - optimizing for joy in our development tools and workflows.

- **Keep joy in the loop**: Tools should create delight, not friction
- **Happy dev, happy life**: The ergonomics equation matters for sustainable productivity
- **Bend the machine to our will**: Facilitate control and personal mastery over our development environment

This principle optimizes the human-computer interface, recognizing that joy is a uniquely human emotion worth explicitly pursuing. Yes, we should optimize for joy and use it as a barometer and metric in our white collar work - it shows authenticity and true calling in our craft.
