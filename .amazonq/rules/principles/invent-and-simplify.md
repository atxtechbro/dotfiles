# Invent and Simplify

Emphasis on simplification, malleability, usefulness, and utilitarian design. Budget token/lines of code optimizing friendly and changeable.

- **Simplifying assumptions**: Find the key insight that makes complex problems simple
- **External awareness**: Look for new ideas from everywhere, not limited by "not invented here"
- **Constant reinvention**: Be willing to completely reinvent approaches, not just iterate
- **Accept misunderstanding**: Be willing to be misunderstood when pursuing genuinely new approaches

**Relationship to other principles:**
- Subtraction Creates Value is a subset of this broader truth
- Supports bold iteration and transformative solutions over incremental improvements

This principle guides agents toward utilitarian solutions that genuinely serve users better.
