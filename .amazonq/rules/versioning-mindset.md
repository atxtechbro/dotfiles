# The Versioning Mindset

The "versioning mindset" is the principle that progress happens through iteration rather than reinvention, where small strategic changes compound over time through active feedback loops. It emphasizes:

- Logging what worked and what didn't, then rolling forward with improvements
- Creating feedback loops across domains so gains in one area reinforce others
- Focusing on incremental improvements rather than complete rewrites
- Building on previous knowledge rather than starting from scratch
- Maintaining history and context to inform future decisions

This principle ensures sustainable, continuous improvement across all aspects of development.
