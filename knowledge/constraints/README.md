# Constraints

In Theory of Constraints, we distinguish between different types of limitations that govern system behavior. This taxonomy helps us apply the Five Focusing Steps appropriately.

## Physical Constraints
Immutable limitations of the system that cannot be changed through policy or procedure.
- Hardware limitations
- API restrictions
- Fundamental architectural boundaries

## Policy Constraints
Self-imposed limitations that could theoretically be changed but currently govern behavior.
- Coding standards
- Workflow requirements
- Organizational decisions

Understanding which type of constraint you're dealing with is critical for proper system optimization.
