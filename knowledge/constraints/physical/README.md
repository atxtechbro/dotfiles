# Physical Constraints

These are the immutable laws of our system - constraints that cannot be overcome through cleverness, policy changes, or architectural decisions. They represent fundamental limitations.

Examples:
- Claude cannot provide interactive input to commands
- Context windows have hard token limits
- API rate limits from external services
