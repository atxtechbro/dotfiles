# Throughput Definition

## The Goal
My throughput is measured by my ability to manage AI agents to become the 100x-1000x developer through parallel execution and systems orchestration.

## Core Metrics
1. **AI Agent Management Capability**: Directing agents across any framework/language
   - PR review velocity as a leading indicator of management effectiveness
   - Minimal diffs maximize review throughput across parallel agents
2. **Productivity Multiplier**: Achieve 100x-1000x productivity through parallel AI orchestration
3. **Systems Thinking Application**: Managing workflows at the macro level, not micro-editing code
4. **Life Stewardship**: Using these systems to manage all aspects of life, stewarding gifts from God to serve others

## Strategic Insight
Frameworks come and go, but the ability to manage expert agents is the durable skill. This is the shift from being a coder to being a manager - just like Alex Rogo's journey in The Goal from managing machines to managing constraints and flow.

## Why This Matters
- **Joy enables sustainability** but isn't the end goal
- **Earnings validate market value** of this management approach
- **Service through excellence** - developing gifts to their fullest
- **Compound returns** - agent management skills improve with each AI generation

## Feedback Loop Alignment
Every principle, procedure, and system should ultimately serve this throughput:
- Does it improve my agent management capability?
- Does it position me better in the marketplace?
- Does it help me serve others through excellence?
- Does it compound over time?

This is the "pillar" in PPV (Pillars, Pipelines, and Vaults) - the fundamental truth everything else supports.
