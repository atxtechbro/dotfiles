# Procedures

Actionable processes and workflows that evolve with experience.

## ðŸš¨ Critical Procedures
- **`creating-slash-commands.md`** - **THE ONLY WAY** to create new slash commands (enforces generation-time validation)
- `command-generation-checklist.md` - Checklist for implementing generation-time validation

## Core Workflows
- `fs-write-full-paths.md` - Always use absolute paths in fs_write operations
- `git-workflow.md` - Git conventions and branch management
- `post-pr-mini-retro.md` - Systems improvement retro after feature PRs
- `worktree-workflow.md` - Git worktree workflow (beta/imperfect system)

## Future Procedure Ideas
- **Self-organizing README**: Automate README.md reorganization based on git log activity patterns (daily GitHub Action analyzing last 1000 commits)
