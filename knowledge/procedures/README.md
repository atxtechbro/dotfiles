# Procedures

Actionable processes and workflows that evolve with experience.

- `git-workflow.md` - Git conventions and branch management
- `post-pr-mini-retro.md` - Systems improvement retro after feature PRs
- `worktree-workflow.md` - Git worktree workflow (beta/imperfect system)

Note: Several files were moved to `../constraints/` as they describe rules and limitations rather than procedures.

## Future Procedure Ideas
- **Self-organizing README**: Automate README.md reorganization based on git log activity patterns (daily GitHub Action analyzing last 1000 commits)
