# Post-PR Mini Retro

After submitting a pull request for feature-related workflows, conduct a mini retro focused on systems improvement. This supports the Snowball Method by capturing learnings and dedicating 20% of time to systems improvement.

## Retro Questions

**What worked well?**
- Which documented procedures were followed successfully?
- What felt smooth and efficient in the workflow?

**What didn't work as expected?**
- Which procedures were unclear or incomplete?
- Where did manual course corrections become necessary?
- What assumptions or approaches needed adjustment?

**Procedure adherence:**
- Which defined procedures were used as documented?
- Which procedures were improvised or done with uncertainty?
- Where did the human need to steer or provide manual input?

**Systems improvement opportunities:**
- What procedures need updating or clarification?
- What new procedures should be documented?
- What tools or workflows could be enhanced?

**Formatting overhead check:**
- Did any requirements feel like unnecessary cognitive load or "formatting overhead"?
- Were there moments where precision requirements (line counts, exact formatting, etc.) made tasks harder than needed?
- What formatting or precision requirements could be relaxed to reduce friction?
- Permission to flag when working harder/longer than necessary due to overly specific constraints

**Tool boundary clarity:**
- Were there moments of uncertainty about which tool to use for a task?
- Which tool descriptions or boundaries could be clearer?
- Which tools needed example usage, edge cases, or input format requirements to be more obvious?
- What tool definitions felt like they needed "prompt engineering attention" to be clearer?

**Principle tensions:**
- Which principles came into tension during decision points?
- Which principle did you lean on when there was conflict, and why?
- How did choosing one principle over another create tension or trade-offs?
- What decisions required balancing competing principles?

This retro helps identify the 20% of systems work that enables the 80% of feature work to flow more smoothly.
