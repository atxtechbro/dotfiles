# Five Focusing Steps

1. Identify the systems constraint
2. Decide how to exploit the systems constraint
3. Subordinate everything else to the above decisions
4. Elevate the systems constraint
5. If, in the previous steps, a constraint has been broken, go back to step 1 but do not allow inertia to cause a system constraint.

In AI-assisted development, the constraint is often the cognitive buffer - both human and AI context windows acting as work-in-process inventory.
