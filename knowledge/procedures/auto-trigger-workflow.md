# Auto-Trigger Workflow

The auto-trigger workflow procedure has been integrated with its implementation for better maintainability and discoverability.

See: `/home/linuxmint-lp/ppv/pillars/dotfiles/.github/actions/auto-trigger-claude/README.md`

This follows the principle of keeping documentation close to implementation - the README now contains both the technical configuration details and the business/procedural context for when and why to use this automation.

Principle: ose (Outside and Slightly Elevated) - auto-creates PRs from issues without manual intervention
