# Git Workflow Rules

Use MCP git tools, follow conventional commits, and maintain branch hygiene to prevent recovery tax.

**When to use**: All git operations in this repository
**Core rules**: 
- Use `mcp__git__*` tools (chain with `git_batch`)
- Conventional commits: `type[scope]: description`
- Never work on main - always branch first
**Details**: See [git-workflow-detailed.md](/docs/procedures/git-workflow-detailed.md)
