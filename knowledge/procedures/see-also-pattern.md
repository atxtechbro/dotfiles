# See Also Pattern

A systems thinking approach to connecting related concepts in our knowledge base, creating an emergent knowledge graph.

## Systems Perspective

Knowledge isn't linear - it's a network. The "See Also" pattern acknowledges that understanding emerges from seeing connections between concepts. Like synapses in a neural network, these links strengthen the overall system's intelligence.

## When to Consider Adding Links

Add a "See Also" section when you notice:
- **Resonance**: Two concepts vibrate at similar frequencies (e.g., Jonah personality resonates with throughput definition through constraint thinking)
- **Implementation relationships**: A procedure actualizes a principle in practice
- **Complementary perspectives**: Different angles on the same truth enhance understanding
- **Source relationships**: Concepts flowing from the same wellspring of wisdom
- **Tension relationships**: Concepts that create productive friction when juxtaposed

## Natural Emergence

Rather than forcing bidirectional links, let connections emerge organically:
- **One-way links are valid**: Sometimes A illuminates B without B needing to reference A
- **Asymmetric relationships exist**: A principle might inform many procedures, but those procedures might not all link back
- **Discovery over prescription**: Links should feel like "aha!" moments, not checkboxes

## Format

Place the "See Also" section at the end, after main content:

```markdown
## See Also
- [Link Text](relative/path/to/file.md) - Nature of the connection
- External Resource - How this enriches understanding
```

## Guiding Principles

1. **Quality over symmetry**: A meaningful one-way link beats a forced bidirectional pair
2. **Context reveals connection**: Brief descriptions help others see what you see
3. **Relative paths for resilience**: Enable navigation regardless of repository location
4. **Restraint maintains signal**: Link only when the connection genuinely enhances understanding
5. **Evolution over perfection**: Links can be added, removed, or changed as understanding deepens

## Examples

**When a principle influences practice:**
```markdown
## See Also
- [Git Workflow](../procedures/git-workflow.md) - How this principle manifests in daily practice
- [Subtraction Creates Value](subtraction-creates-value.md) - Complementary principle for decision-making
```

**When discovering source wisdom:**
```markdown
## See Also
- The Goal by Eliyahu M. Goldratt - Wellspring of Theory of Constraints thinking
- [Throughput Definition](../throughput-definition.md) - How we've adapted ToC for AI agent management
```

## System Benefits

- **Emergent understanding**: Patterns become visible through the network of connections
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Follow links rather than holding everything in memory
- **Natural documentation**: The link structure itself documents relationships
- **Future tooling potential**: Graph visualization, link analysis, concept clustering

This pattern embodies [Systems Stewardship](../principles/systems-stewardship.md) by creating structures that reveal rather than impose order.
