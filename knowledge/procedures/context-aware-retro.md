# Context-Aware Retro

After any significant work, conduct a retro focused on systems improvement. This supports the Snowball Method by capturing learnings and dedicating 20% of time to systems improvement.

**Wring out the towel**: Extract every drop of learning from each experience - the insights that seem obvious in hindsight are often the most valuable to document. **Never let a crisis go to waste**: Each failure or unexpected challenge becomes raw material for stronger systems and procedures.

## Human-Led Collaborative Process

**The human drives the retro while actively inviting agent participation:**

1. **Human initiates**: "Let's retro this context and mine the gleanings"
2. **Human leads with questions**: Guide the discussion based on what just happened
3. **Agent provides observations**: Share specific insights when asked
4. **Collaborative exploration**: Both parties dig into learnings together
5. **Human confirms completion**: Explicitly confirm when the retro is complete

The human should:
- Drive based on the current context (post-PR, crisis, debugging, etc.)
- Ask specific questions about what just occurred
- Seek agent observations on decision points and tensions
- Focus on extracting actionable systems improvements

## Context-Aware Questions

**What worked well?**
- Which documented procedures were followed successfully?
- What felt smooth and efficient in the workflow?

**What didn't work as expected?**
- Which procedures were unclear or incomplete?
- Where did manual course corrections become necessary?
- What assumptions or approaches needed adjustment?

**Procedure adherence:**
- Which defined procedures were used as documented?
- Which procedures were improvised or done with uncertainty?
- Where did manual steering become necessary?

**Systems improvement opportunities:**
- What procedures need updating or clarification?
- What new procedures should be documented?
- What tools or workflows could be enhanced?

**Principle tensions:**
- Which principles came into tension during decision points?
- Which principle did you lean on when there was conflict, and why?
- How did choosing one principle over another create tension or trade-offs?
- What decisions required balancing competing principles?

This retro adapts to whatever context triggered it - mining gleanings from the work that just happened to identify the 20% of systems work that enables the 80% of feature work to flow more smoothly.
