# Continuous Improvement

The principle that every experience contains gleanings worth extracting - insights that compound over time to strengthen systems and capabilities.

**Wring out the towel**: Extract every drop of learning from each experience. The insights that seem obvious in hindsight are often the most valuable to document.

**Never let a crisis go to waste**: Each failure or unexpected challenge becomes raw material for stronger systems and procedures.

## The Spirit of Retrospection

- **Mine the gleanings**: Look for patterns, tensions, and insights in whatever context just occurred
- **Systems lens**: Focus on what would make future work flow more smoothly
- **Principle tensions**: Notice when principles came into conflict and how decisions were made
- **Compound learning**: Capture insights that build on previous knowledge

## Collaborative Discovery

The human drives the exploration while the agent provides observations when asked. This isn't a checklist - it's a conversation guided by curiosity about what can be learned and improved.

**Context-aware**: The retrospective adapts to whatever just happened - post-PR work, crisis response, debugging sessions, or any significant effort.

**Improvement focus**: What procedures need updating? What new patterns emerged? Which approaches felt natural versus forced?

This principle transforms any pause into an opportunity for systems strengthening through reflective learning. See [Procedure Creation](../procedures/procedure-creation.md) for capturing ghost procedures discovered during retros.
