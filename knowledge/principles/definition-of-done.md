# Definition of Done = Hardened

A task isn't complete until it survives the "spilled coffee test" - if your laptop dies, can you recreate the state?

- **Hardened**: Embedded in setup scripts, not just working
- **Source-controlled**: Committed to the repository
- **Reproducible**: Anyone (including future-you) can recreate it
- **Documented**: At minimum, a note about how it was done

**The Spilled Coffee Test:**
If coffee spills on your laptop and you need to start fresh, will this work persist? If not, it's not done.

**Levels of hardening:**
1. **Minimum**: Note in documentation explaining the manual process
2. **Better**: Script that automates the process
3. **Best**: Integrated into existing setup flows

This definition ensures work compounds rather than evaporates. Each "done" task makes the system more resilient.
