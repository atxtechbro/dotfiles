# Outside and Slightly Elevated (OSE)

Adopt an external vantage point to see systems rather than getting entangled in details. From Sam Carpenter's "Work the System."

- **Step back**: Remove yourself from the chaos of implementation
- **See the system**: View work as interconnected processes that can be optimized
- **Manager, not coder**: Direct and review rather than implement
- **Strategic over tactical**: Focus on leverage points, not individual fixes

**The Spanish proverb connection:**
"VÃ­steme despacio, que tengo prisa" (Dress me slowly, I'm in a hurry) - rushing leads to mistakes. From the elevated position, we move deliberately.

**In practice:**
- When tempted to dive into code, ask "What would I delegate?"
- Focus on outcomes and constraints, not implementation
- Review and refine systems rather than creating from scratch
- Maintain perspective when others are firefighting

This perspective enables clear decision-making and reduces emotional reactivity to individual issues.
