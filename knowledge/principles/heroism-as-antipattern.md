# Heroism as Antipattern

The impulse to be a "macho hero" through one-off fixes and firefighting is counterproductive. Reject heroics in favor of systematic solutions.

- **No firefighting**: Address root causes, not symptoms
- **No one-offs**: Every fix should be embedded in setup scripts or procedures
- **No manual heroics**: If it's not automated or documented, it's not done
- **Scalable over impressive**: Prioritize solutions that compound over time

**Examples of heroism (avoid these):**
- Manually copying files instead of using symlinks in setup scripts
- Quick patches that "fix it for now" without documentation
- Solving problems through memory rather than procedures

**Instead, embrace:**
- Hardened, embedded solutions that survive the "spilled coffee test"
- Source-controlled fixes that scale
- Systems that grow stronger with each iteration

This principle mandates both human and AI agents to resist the temptation of quick heroic fixes in favor of sustainable systems.
