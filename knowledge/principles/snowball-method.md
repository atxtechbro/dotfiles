# The Snowball Method

The "snowball method" focuses on continuous knowledge accumulation and compounding improvements. Like a snowball rolling downhill, gathering more snow and momentum, this principle emphasizes:

- Persistent context: Each development session builds on accumulated knowledge from previous sessions
- Virtuous cycle: Tools and systems become more effective the more they're used
- Knowledge persistence: Documentation, configuration, and context are preserved and enhanced over time
- Compounding returns: Small improvements accumulate and multiply rather than remaining isolated
- Reduced cognitive load: Less need to "re-learn" or "re-discover" previous solutions

This principle ensures that our development environment continuously improves over time.
