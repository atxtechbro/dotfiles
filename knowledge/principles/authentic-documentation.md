# Authentic Documentation

Documentation should be genuine notes to future self, not performative theater.

- **Anti-impressive**: Avoid sounding like an expert when you're learning
- **Honest tone**: Reflect actual understanding, caution, and uncertainty
- **Personal voice**: Let your vibes and style come through
- **Context-appropriate**: Front page can be more polished, subfolder READMEs stay raw

**What authentic looks like:**
- "I think this works but haven't tested edge cases"
- Quick notes that capture the essence
- Informal language that future-you will understand
- Warnings about what's still messy

**What theater looks like:**
- Over-polished prose trying to impress
- Documentation that hides uncertainty
- Generic "professional" voice
- Content optimized for imagined employers

Optimize for authenticity over appearances. The best documentation helps future-you (and AI) get oriented quickly.
