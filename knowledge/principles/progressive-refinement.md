# Principle of Progressive Refinement

Complex solutions emerge from simple, verified components. Build confidence through small, validated steps rather than large leaps.

## Core Concept
Start simple, verify it works, then add complexity. Each layer builds on a solid foundation of previously verified functionality.

## In Practice
- Begin with simplest possible implementation
- Add features incrementally, verifying each addition
- Refactor only after tests pass
- Complexity emerges from composition of simple parts

## Connection to Other Principles
- **Incremental Certainty**: Each refinement maintains stability
- **Subtraction Creates Value**: Sometimes refinement means removing
- **Invent and Simplify**: Find simplest path to each increment

This principle encourages incremental development and emergent design, allowing complex systems to grow organically from well-tested foundations.
