# Systems Stewardship

The principle of maintaining and improving systems through consistent patterns, documentation, and procedures that enable sustainable growth and knowledge transfer.

- Establishing reusable patterns and procedures for common tasks
- Documenting systems for future maintainers and contributors
- Creating consistent interfaces and conventions across tools
- Building systems that compound in value through standardization
- Prioritizing maintainability and knowledge preservation over quick fixes

**Connection to other concepts:**
- Draws from Systems Thinking (Peter Senge's "The Fifth Discipline")
- Supports the 80/20 automation ratio from the Snowball Method
- Opposes heroism and firefighting in favor of sustainable growth

**The OSE Perspective (Outside and Slightly Elevated):**
From Sam Carpenter's "Work the System" - adopt an external vantage point to see systems rather than getting entangled in details. This elevated perspective enables clear decision-making and reduces emotional reactivity.

**In practice:**
- Add to existing procedures rather than creating new ones (less risky)
- Document the "how" so knowledge doesn't stay tribal
- Make systems malleable for future iteration (VM)
- When tempted to dive in, ask "What would I delegate?"
- "VÃ­steme despacio, que tengo prisa" - move deliberately, not frantically

This principle ensures that systems remain accessible, improvable, and transferable rather than becoming tribal knowledge or technical debt.
