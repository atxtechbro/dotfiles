# Systems Stewardship

The principle of maintaining and improving systems through consistent patterns, documentation, and procedures that enable sustainable growth and knowledge transfer.

- Establishing reusable patterns and procedures for common tasks
- Documenting systems for future maintainers and contributors
- Creating consistent interfaces and conventions across tools
- Building systems that compound in value through standardization
- Prioritizing maintainability and knowledge preservation over quick fixes

**Connection to other concepts:**
- Draws from Systems Thinking (Peter Senge's "The Fifth Discipline")
- Supports the 80/20 automation ratio from the Snowball Method
- Opposes heroism and firefighting in favor of sustainable growth

**The OSE Perspective:** See [OSE (Outside and Slightly Elevated)](ose.md) for the external vantage point that enables clear decision-making and reduces emotional reactivity.

**In practice:**
- Add to existing procedures rather than creating new ones (less risky)
- Document the "how" so knowledge doesn't stay tribal
- Make systems malleable for future iteration (VM)
- When tempted to dive in, ask "What would I delegate?"
- "VÃ­steme despacio, que tengo prisa" - move deliberately, not frantically
- **Never let a crisis go to waste**: Each failure becomes input for stronger procedures and prevention systems
- **Leave cookie crumbs**: Document architectural decisions inline where future engineers encounter them. Git commit messages fade into history; inline comments create discoverable breadcrumbs for faster resolution.
- **Gitignore as architectural documentation**: Every gitignore entry embeds meaning about system structure. `# Setup-generated symlinks (avoid duplicating tracked content)` tells the story of why `.claude/command-templates` exists. Each line is a clue to underlying architecture, not just file exclusion.

**GitHub Issues as WIP Inventory:**
- Backlog buildup indicates bottlenecks in the development flow
- Leading vs lagging indicators: measure what predicts success, not what confirms it
- Regular backlog cleanup = inventory reduction

This principle ensures that systems remain accessible, improvable, and transferable rather than becoming tribal knowledge or technical debt.
