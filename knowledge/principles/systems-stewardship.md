# Systems Stewardship

The principle of maintaining and improving systems through consistent patterns, documentation, and procedures that enable sustainable growth and knowledge transfer.

- Establishing reusable patterns and procedures for common tasks
- Documenting systems for future maintainers and contributors
- Creating consistent interfaces and conventions across tools
- Building systems that compound in value through standardization
- Prioritizing maintainability and knowledge preservation over quick fixes

**Connection to other concepts:**
- Draws from Systems Thinking (Peter Senge's "The Fifth Discipline")
- Supports the 80/20 automation ratio from the Snowball Method
- Opposes heroism and firefighting in favor of sustainable growth

**The OSE Perspective (Outside and Slightly Elevated):**
From Sam Carpenter's "Work the System" - adopt an external vantage point to see systems rather than getting entangled in details. This elevated perspective enables clear decision-making and reduces emotional reactivity.

**In practice:**
- Add to existing procedures rather than creating new ones (less risky)
- Document the "how" so knowledge doesn't stay tribal
- Make systems malleable for future iteration (VM)
- When tempted to dive in, ask "What would I delegate?"
- "VÃ­steme despacio, que tengo prisa" - move deliberately, not frantically
- **Never let a crisis go to waste**: Each failure becomes input for stronger procedures and prevention systems

**Cookie Crumbs Documentation Pattern:**
Leave decision breadcrumbs throughout procedures - the "why" behind choices that seem obvious now but won't be obvious in 6 months. This prevents future confusion and reduces the need to reverse-engineer past decisions.

- Document the context that led to specific choices
- Explain why alternatives were rejected
- Note assumptions that informed the decision
- Reference the problem state that necessitated the solution
- Leave traces of the decision-making process, not just the final outcome

**Example applications:**
- In git workflow: Why we chose specific branch naming patterns
- In tool selection: What problems each tool solves vs alternatives
- In procedure design: What failure modes each step prevents
- In automation: What manual processes were replaced and why

**GitHub Issues as WIP Inventory:**
- Backlog buildup indicates bottlenecks in the development flow
- Leading vs lagging indicators: measure what predicts success, not what confirms it
- Regular backlog cleanup = inventory reduction

This principle ensures that systems remain accessible, improvable, and transferable rather than becoming tribal knowledge or technical debt.
