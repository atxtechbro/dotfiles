# Principles

Foundational truths that guide development across all projects.

## The Goal
- `throughput-definition.md` - **The North Star**: AI agent management capability for top 2% positioning

## Operating Principles
- `invent-and-simplify.md` - Constant reinvention and simplifying assumptions
- `ose.md` - Outside and Slightly Elevated perspective for clear decision-making
- `snowball-method.md` - Compound returns through stacking daily wins (1% better every day)
- `subtraction-creates-value.md` - Strategic removal often creates more value than addition
- `systems-stewardship.md` - Maintaining systems through patterns and documentation
- `tracer-bullets.md` - Rapid feedback-driven development with ground truth
- `transparency-in-agent-work.md` - Make agent reasoning visible during reviews
- `versioning-mindset.md` (VM) - Iteration over reinvention
