# Principles

Foundational truths that guide development across all projects.

## The Goal
- `throughput-definition.md` - **The North Star**: AI agent management capability for top 2% positioning

## Operating Principles
- `invent-and-simplify.md` - Constant reinvention and simplifying assumptions
- `subtraction-creates-value.md` - Strategic removal often creates more value than addition
- `systems-stewardship.md` - Maintaining systems through patterns and documentation (includes OSE perspective)
- `tracer-bullets.md` - Rapid feedback-driven development with ground truth
- `transparency-in-agent-work.md` - Make agent reasoning visible during reviews
- `versioning-mindset.md` (VM) - Iteration over reinvention

## Test-Driven Development Principles
- `verifiable-intent.md` - Establish clear, measurable success criteria before building
- `incremental-certainty.md` - Commit only verified, stable states
- `failure-first-learning.md` - Understand failure detection before attempting success
- `isolated-iteration.md` - Change implementation while keeping criteria constant
- `progressive-refinement.md` - Build complex solutions from simple, verified components
