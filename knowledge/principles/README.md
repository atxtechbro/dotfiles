# Principles

Foundational truths that guide development across all projects.

## The Goal
- `../throughput-definition.md` - **The North Star**: AI agent management capability for top 2% positioning

## Operating Principles
- `ai-harness-agnosticism.md` - **Crisis-Proven**: Interchangeable AI harnesses for service outage resilience
- `config-in-environment.md` - 🧩 **12-Factor III**: Store configuration in environment, not code (enables agent shareability)
- `eager-evolution.md` - **Living System**: Eagerly seeks to evolve, self-heal, and fit like a well-worn glove
- `invent-and-simplify.md` - Constant reinvention and simplifying assumptions
- `no-leaks.md` - Keep company details private while enabling rich AI context via gitignored documentation
- `ose.md` - Outside and Slightly Elevated perspective for clear decision-making
- `permissive-default-surgical-removal.md` - Start with maximum capability, remove only specific risks
- `pr-readability-contract.md` - Optimize PRs for human review by moving defensive checks to system boundaries
- `snowball-method.md` - Continuous knowledge accumulation and compounding improvements
- `subtraction-creates-value.md` - Strategic removal often creates more value than addition
- `systems-stewardship.md` - Maintaining systems through patterns and documentation
- `tracer-bullets.md` - Rapid feedback-driven development with ground truth
- `transparency-in-agent-work.md` - Make agent reasoning visible during reviews
- `versioning-mindset.md` (VM) - Iteration over reinvention
