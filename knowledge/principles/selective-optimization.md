# Selective Optimization

Prioritize tasks that will make all future tasks easier by creating and fostering positive feedback loops, to ensure efforts create compounding benefits. Prioritize tasks and workflows with the highest value-to-effort ratio. Focus on completing tasks that are close to done and deliver immediate value upon completion.

## Throughput Components
- Throughput = capability + joy (not just code output)
- 80/20 split: 20% systems work enables 80% delivery
- Local optimizations that don't increase throughput = waste
- See `../throughput-definition.md` for the ultimate Goal
