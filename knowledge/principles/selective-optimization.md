# Selective Optimization

Prioritize tasks that will make all future tasks easier by creating and fostering positive feedback loops, to ensure efforts create compounding benefits. Prioritize tasks and workflows with the highest value-to-effort ratio. Focus on completing tasks that are close to done and deliver immediate value upon completion.
