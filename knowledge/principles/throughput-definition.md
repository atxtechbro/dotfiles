# Throughput Definition

## The Goal
My throughput is measured by my ability to manage AI agents to complete assigned work while maintaining a competitive skills portfolio in the software engineering marketplace.

## Core Metrics
1. **AI Agent Management Capability**: Directing agents across any framework/language
2. **Marketplace Positioning**: Top 2% earning potential through strategic skill development
3. **Systems Thinking Application**: Managing workflows, not just writing code
4. **Life Stewardship**: Using these systems to manage all aspects of life, stewarding gifts from God to serve others

## Strategic Insight
Frameworks come and go, but the ability to manage expert agents is the durable skill. This is the shift from being a coder to being a manager - just like Alex Rogo's journey in The Goal from managing machines to managing constraints and flow.

## Why This Matters
- **Joy enables sustainability** but isn't the end goal
- **Earnings validate market value** of this management approach
- **Service through excellence** - developing gifts to their fullest
- **Compound returns** - agent management skills improve with each AI generation

## Feedback Loop Alignment
Every principle, procedure, and system should ultimately serve this throughput:
- Does it improve my agent management capability?
- Does it position me better in the marketplace?
- Does it help me serve others through excellence?
- Does it compound over time?

This is the "pillar" in PPV (Pillars, Pipelines, and Vaults) - the fundamental truth everything else supports.
