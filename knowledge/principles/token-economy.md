# Token Economy

Every token in documentation and code must pull its weight. With Claude's 200k context window constraint, efficiency matters.

- **Radical brevity**: Keep knowledge files short, link to details when needed
- **Budget consciousness**: Shortened variable names, concise output
- **Markdown as universal language**: Human and machine readable
- **Value density**: Each character must earn its place

**Application:**
- Write notes to future self, not impressive documentation
- Prioritize clarity over sophistication
- Design for AI context loading, not human browsing
- README.md as AI navigation index, not marketing material

**The audience hierarchy:**
1. AI starting with 0/200k tokens
2. Future self needing quick reminders
3. External readers (distant third)

This principle ensures efficient use of limited attention spans - both AI and human.
