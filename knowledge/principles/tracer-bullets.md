# Tracer Bullets Development

Like military tracer rounds that help soldiers adjust their aim in real-time, each iteration provides immediate feedback to guide the next action.

- **Ground truth at each step**: Gain concrete feedback from the environment (tool results, code execution, system responses)
- **Progress assessment**: Each cycle/loop/iteration should feel like getting closer to the target
- **Human checkpoint pauses**: Stop for feedback when encountering blockers or at natural decision points
- **Commit early and often**: Each commit is a tracer round showing trajectory
- **Short feedback loops over long planning**: Rapid iteration beats extensive upfront design
- **Stopping conditions**: Maintain control with maximum iterations or clear completion criteria
- **AI-human feedback loop**: Core to this approach - neither operates in isolation

This principle enables effective development in unfamiliar territory by providing constant course correction through environmental feedback.
