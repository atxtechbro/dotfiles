# Principle of Isolated Iteration

When pursuing a target outcome, adjust only the implementation while keeping success criteria constant. Iterate until alignment is achieved.

## Core Concept
Change one variable at a time. Keep verification criteria stable while refining implementation. This isolation enables clear cause-and-effect understanding and systematic progress.

## In Practice
- Hold tests constant while changing code
- Modify implementation without changing requirements
- Iterate on solution, not on problem definition
- Use stable criteria as North Star for development

## Connection to Other Principles
- **Incremental Certainty**: Each iteration builds on verified foundation
- **Tracer Bullets**: Rapid feedback on implementation changes
- **Versioning Mindset**: Iterative refinement toward target

This principle creates the natural test-code-iterate loop of TDD without prescribing it, allowing flexible implementation while maintaining focus on outcomes.
