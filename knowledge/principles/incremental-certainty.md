# Principle of Incremental Certainty

Commit to permanent record only what has been verified to work correctly. Each commitment should represent a stable, known-good state.

## Core Concept
Progress happens through small, verified steps rather than large leaps of faith. Each saved state should be functional and tested, building confidence incrementally.

## In Practice
- Only commit code that passes verification
- Each commit represents a working state
- Small, frequent commits over large, infrequent ones
- Build confidence through accumulation of verified changes

## Connection to Other Principles
- **Versioning Mindset**: Iteration through verified increments
- **Tracer Bullets**: Each commit is a tracer round showing progress
- **Systems Stewardship**: Maintaining system stability at each step

This principle encourages commit discipline without prescribing when to commit, naturally leading to a test-driven workflow where verification precedes permanence.
