# OSE (Outside and Slightly Elevated)

A software engineer's embrace of the manager mindset - stepping back from line-by-line editing to orchestrate AI agents and systems. This elevated perspective enables the strategic thinking needed to serve teams and maximize impact in an AI-driven world.

## Core Concept

OSE represents the shift from coder to conductor. Instead of getting lost in implementation details, you maintain the external vantage point needed to direct AI agents, design workflows, and solve problems at the systems level. This isn't about avoiding technical work - it's about operating at the altitude where your unique human judgment creates the most value.

## Why This Matters Now

As AI capabilities accelerate, the most valuable skillset shifts from writing code to managing intelligent systems. This principle positions you to:

- **Serve teams more effectively**: Lead through systems thinking rather than heroic individual contributions
- **Maximize your calling**: Use your gifts to create lasting impact through better processes and agent orchestration
- **Build durable skills**: Agent management capabilities compound with each AI generation
- **Prevent firefighting**: Avoid the reactive patterns that lead to burnout and technical debt

## Micro vs Macro: The 100x Productivity Multiplier

The productivity gains from OSE aren't just subjective - they're mathematical. You're shifting from single-threaded to multi-threaded mental models.

**Micro Level (Traditional IDE Development):**
- Navigate between files in Visual Studio/Cursor/IntelliJ/neovim
- Edit individual lines of code sequentially
- Debug line-by-line, file-by-file
- Single-threaded mental model: one change at a time
- Cognitive overhead of remembering file locations, syntax, implementation details

**Macro Level ([tmux + git worktrees + Claude Code](../procedures/tmux-git-worktrees-claude-code.md)):**
- Manage tasks at the system level
- Compose complex tasks from multiple subtasks
- Execute multiple tasks in parallel using AI agents
- Multi-threaded mental model: orchestrate multiple streams simultaneously
- Focus on problem definition, principles, and outcomes while agents handle implementation

**The Math:**
Instead of `1 developer × 1 task × 1 file at a time = linear productivity`, you get `1 developer × N tasks × parallel execution = exponential productivity`.

How could this NOT be 100x-1000x more productive? You're not just faster - you're operating at a fundamentally different level. This is computational parallelism applied to human work, and the skill itself becomes exponentially more valuable as AI capabilities advance.

## In Practice

- Ask "What would I delegate?" before diving into manual work
- Review at the PR level rather than edit-by-edit
- Design procedures that agents can follow consistently
- Focus on the "why" and "what" while letting agents handle the "how"
- Maintain calm perspective during crisis situations - systems thinking over emotional reactions

## Relationship to Other Principles

- **[Spilled Coffee Principle](../../../README.md)**: OSE prevents the firefighting that creates fragile systems
- **[Systems Stewardship](systems-stewardship.md)**: OSE provides the perspective needed for effective stewardship
- **[Tracer Bullets](tracer-bullets.md)**: PR-level review maintains appropriate altitude for feedback
- **[Subtraction Creates Value](subtraction-creates-value.md)**: External view makes it easier to identify what to remove
- **[Versioning Mindset](versioning-mindset.md)**: Elevated perspective supports continuous iteration over reinvention

This principle ensures that you operate as a manager of systems and agents rather than getting entangled in the details of individual tasks - a skillset that becomes more valuable as AI capabilities advance.
