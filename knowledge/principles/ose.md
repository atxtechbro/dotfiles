# OSE (Outside and Slightly Elevated)

From Sam Carpenter's "Work the System" - adopt an external vantage point to see systems rather than getting entangled in details. This elevated perspective enables clear decision-making and reduces emotional reactivity.

## Core Concept

The OSE perspective is about stepping back from the immediate details and observing the system as a whole. Rather than getting caught up in the mechanics of individual tasks, you maintain a higher-level view that allows you to see patterns, bottlenecks, and opportunities for improvement.

## Benefits

- **Clear decision-making**: External perspective reduces emotional attachment to specific approaches
- **Reduced reactivity**: Elevated view prevents getting pulled into urgency traps
- **Systems thinking**: Enables seeing connections and patterns across workflows
- **Delegation readiness**: "What would I delegate?" becomes a natural question
- **Strategic focus**: Maintains attention on what matters most

## In Practice

- When tempted to dive into details, ask "What would I delegate?"
- Review work at the PR level rather than edit-by-edit
- Focus on procedures and patterns rather than one-off solutions
- Maintain perspective during crisis situations
- Use systems language: "How does this fit the larger pattern?"

## Relationship to Other Principles

- **Systems Stewardship**: OSE provides the perspective needed for effective stewardship
- **Tracer Bullets**: PR-level review maintains appropriate altitude for feedback
- **Subtraction Creates Value**: External view makes it easier to identify what to remove
- **Versioning Mindset**: Elevated perspective supports continuous iteration over reinvention

This principle ensures that you operate as a manager of systems rather than getting entangled in the details of individual tasks.
