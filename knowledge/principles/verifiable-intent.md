# Principle of Verifiable Intent

Before creating any solution, establish clear, measurable criteria for success that can be independently verified.

## Core Concept
Success criteria must be concrete enough that anyone could independently verify whether they're met. This naturally guides toward creating tests or other verification methods without explicitly requiring them.

## In Practice
- Define what "done" looks like before starting
- Create observable, measurable success criteria
- Ensure criteria are specific, not vague aspirations
- Anyone should be able to check if criteria are satisfied

## Connection to Other Principles
- **Tracer Bullets**: Each verification provides feedback to guide the next step
- **Systems Stewardship**: Verification criteria become living documentation
- **Transparency in Agent Work**: Clear criteria make decision-making visible

This principle ensures that development begins with the end in mind, creating natural guard rails for quality without prescriptive methodology.
