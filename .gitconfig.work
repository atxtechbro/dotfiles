# Work Git Configuration
# This file should be included in your main .gitconfig using:
#
# [includeIf "gitdir:~/Flywire/"]
#     path = ~/ppv/pillars/dotfiles/.gitconfig.work
#
# [includeIf "gitdir:~/Sertifi/"]
#     path = ~/ppv/pillars/dotfiles/.gitconfig.work
#
# This follows the modular Git configuration approach described in the README.md
