# Hardware Benchmarking for Raspberry Pi CI Runners

This module provides tools and scripts for comprehensive hardware benchmarking of Raspberry Pi CI runners.

## Purpose

Evaluate and compare different hardware configurations to optimize CI performance:

- Storage performance (SD cards, SSDs, USB drives)
- Memory management and swap configurations
- CPU performance under different governor settings
- Thermal behavior and cooling solutions
- Network throughput for artifact transfers
- Power consumption under various workloads

## Planned Features

- Automated benchmarking suite that can be triggered via GitHub Actions
- Comparative analysis between different Pi models (3B+, 4B, 5)
- Performance visualization and reporting
- Recommendations engine based on benchmark results
- Thermal imaging integration (optional)

## Use Cases

- Determine optimal hardware configurations for specific CI workloads
- Create evidence-based documentation and recommendations
- Identify performance bottlenecks in CI pipelines
- Test impact of different cooling solutions
- Compare cost-effectiveness of hardware upgrades
