# Linting Optimization for Raspberry Pi CI Runners

This module provides optimizations and configurations for running linting jobs efficiently on Raspberry Pi CI runners.

## Purpose

Maximize linting performance on resource-constrained Raspberry Pi hardware:

- Optimize memory usage for language-specific linters
- Implement efficient caching strategies for dependencies
- Configure parallel linting for multi-core utilization
- Minimize disk I/O during linting operations

## Supported Linting Tools

- JavaScript/TypeScript: ESLint, Prettier
- Python: Pylint, Flake8, Black
- Infrastructure: Terraform, Kubernetes
- Shell: ShellCheck
- And more to be added
