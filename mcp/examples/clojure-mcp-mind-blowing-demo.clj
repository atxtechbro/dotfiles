;; Mind-Blowing Clojure MCP Demo
;; This file demonstrates the incredible power of REPL-based development with MCP
;; To run this demo:
;; 1. Start the Clojure MCP server: clj-mcp-start
;; 2. In a new terminal: clj-mcp mcp/examples/clojure-mcp-mind-blowing-demo.clj

;; This demo showcases how the "Snowball Method" creates a virtuous cycle of
;; knowledge accumulation and compounding improvements over time.

;; PART 1: CONTEXT ACCUMULATION
;; ============================

;; Let's define a complex domain model for a fictional system
(def domain-model
  {:entities
   [{:name "User"
     :attributes [{:name "id" :type :uuid :primary-key true}
                  {:name "username" :type :string}
                  {:name "email" :type :string}
                  {:name "created_at" :type :timestamp}]}
    {:name "Project"
     :attributes [{:name "id" :type :uuid :primary-key true}
                  {:name "name" :type :string}
                  {:name "description" :type :string}
                  {:name "owner_id" :type :uuid :references "User.id"}
                  {:name "created_at" :type :timestamp}]}
    {:name "Task"
     :attributes [{:name "id" :type :uuid :primary-key true}
                  {:name "title" :type :string}
                  {:name "description" :type :string}
                  {:name "status" :type :enum :values ["todo" "in_progress" "done"]}
                  {:name "project_id" :type :uuid :references "Project.id"}
                  {:name "assignee_id" :type :uuid :references "User.id"}
                  {:name "due_date" :type :timestamp}
                  {:name "created_at" :type :timestamp}]}]
   :relationships
   [{:name "UserProjects"
     :from "User"
     :to "Project"
     :type :one-to-many
     :from-key "id"
     :to-key "owner_id"}
    {:name "ProjectTasks"
     :from "Project"
     :to "Task"
     :type :one-to-many
     :from-key "id"
     :to-key "project_id"}
    {:name "UserTasks"
     :from "User"
     :to "Task"
     :type :one-to-many
     :from-key "id"
     :to-key "assignee_id"}]})

;; Now, let's ask the AI to analyze this model and suggest improvements
;; The AI will have the full context of the domain model in its session history

;; PART 2: INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
;; ==============================

;; Let's define a function to generate SQL schema from our domain model
(defn generate-sql-schema [domain-model]
  ;; This is intentionally left incomplete
  ;; Ask the AI to implement this function based on the domain model
  ;; The AI will have the context of both the domain model and this function signature
  )

;; PART 3: KNOWLEDGE PERSISTENCE
;; ============================

;; Let's define a complex algorithm that we'll develop incrementally with AI assistance
(defn analyze-task-dependencies [tasks]
  ;; This function should:
  ;; 1. Build a dependency graph of tasks
  ;; 2. Detect circular dependencies
  ;; 3. Calculate the critical path
  ;; 4. Estimate completion time
  ;; Ask the AI to implement this step by step
  )

;; PART 4: COMPOUNDING RETURNS
;; ===========================

;; Now let's create a simulation that uses all the previous context
;; This demonstrates how knowledge compounds over time

(defn simulate-project-progress [project tasks users]
  ;; This function should simulate the progress of a project over time
  ;; It should use the domain model, SQL schema, and task dependencies
  ;; Ask the AI to implement this function
  )

;; PART 5: THE MIND-BLOWING MOMENT
;; ==============================

;; Now for the truly impressive part - ask the AI to:
;; 1. Generate a complete implementation of all the functions above
;; 2. Create a visualization of the project simulation
;; 3. Explain how the implementation relates to the domain model
;; 4. Suggest optimizations based on the entire context
;; 5. Generate tests for the implementation

;; The AI will have accumulated all the context from the previous parts
;; and will be able to generate a comprehensive solution that would be
;; impossible without the persistent context provided by the REPL-based workflow.

;; This demonstrates the "Snowball Method" in action - each part builds on
;; the previous ones, creating a virtuous cycle of knowledge accumulation
;; and compounding improvements.
