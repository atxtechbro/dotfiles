# AI Documentation Improvements

Summary of improvements inspired by Freestyle's documentation revamp.

## What We Implemented

### 1. **knowledge/llms.txt** - Complete AI Context
- Auto-generated file containing all principles, procedures, and MCP documentation
- Single file AI agents can consume for full repository understanding
- Regenerated automatically during setup.sh
- Added to .gitignore since it's generated

### 2. **Action-Oriented MCP Descriptions**
- Transformed passive descriptions to active "Use this for..." language
- Makes tool selection immediate and obvious for AI agents
- Example: "Git operations" → "Use this for all git operations"

### 3. **knowledge/ai-index.md** - Central AI Hub
- "When you need to..." navigation structure
- Direct links to relevant procedures and principles
- Quick reference for common tasks
- Tool selection guide

### 4. **mcp/tool-discovery.md** - Semantic Tool Mapping
- Maps common tasks to specific tools
- "I need to..." → "Use this tool"
- Includes common patterns and workflows
- Quick reference table

### 5. **mcp/mcp.json.md** - Config Explanation
- Markdown explanation of the JSON configuration
- Helps AI agents understand the structure
- Troubleshooting guide included
- Best practices documented

### 6. **Auto-Generation During Setup**
- Added llms.txt generation to setup.sh
- Ensures AI context stays fresh
- No manual maintenance required

## Why These Matter

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: AI agents can quickly find what they need
2. **Better Tool Selection**: Action-oriented language guides correct tool use
3. **Complete Context**: llms.txt provides everything in one consumable file
4. **Semantic Discovery**: Natural language task mapping to tools
5. **Self-Maintaining**: Auto-generation keeps documentation current

## Next Steps

These improvements could be enhanced with:
- MCP server for dynamic documentation queries
- Proactive documentation suggestions in commands
- Analytics on which docs AI agents access most
- Version tracking for llms.txt changes

The key insight from Freestyle: Make documentation actively consumable by AI, not just readable by humans.
