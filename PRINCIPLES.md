# Personal Principles

This document contains guiding principles for personal and professional development. It serves as a reference for maintaining focus, purpose, and alignment with core values.

## Strategic Objective

> To steward my life and the generous abilities God has gifted me by enjoying my work, working with purpose and ownership, and trusting in Christ as my identity. My vision is to create value and reflect God's creativity while honoring Him in all that I do. I pray for joy in my work, not to prove myself, but to serve, create, and provideâ€”especially for my future wife and family.
> 
> I aim to live with humility, working quietly and deliberately, seeking discernment from the Holy Spirit for tasks, workflows, and partnerships that matter. My focus is on planting seeds, trusting God to grow them, and delighting in the process of tilling the soil each day.
