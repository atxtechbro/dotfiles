# Personal Principles

This document contains guiding principles for personal and professional development. It serves as a reference for maintaining focus, purpose, and alignment with core values.

## Strategic Objective

> To steward my life and the generous abilities God has gifted me by enjoying my work, working with purpose and ownership, and trusting in Christ as my identity. My vision is to create value and reflect God's creativity while honoring Him in all that I do. I pray for joy in my work, not to prove myself, but to serve, create, and provide—especially for my future wife and family.
> 
> I aim to live with humility, working quietly and deliberately, seeking discernment from the Holy Spirit for tasks, workflows, and partnerships that matter. My focus is on planting seeds, trusting God to grow them, and delighting in the process of tilling the soil each day.

## Working Procedures

### Systems Thinking
Treat work and life as interconnected systems. Optimize and balance nodes in the system while expecting adjustments to maintain harmony.

### System Review
System reviews are the heartbeat of growth – personally and professionally. Block time weekly to reflect candidly: what worked, what didn't, and what wins stacked up? In teams, lean into the "touchy-feely"; it's where gold hides. Honesty trumps saving face, whether in sprint retrospectives or personal reviews. Stay disciplined: keep sessions focused, regular, and never just go through the motions. This is deep learning time – embrace it, and watch how fun progress becomes when you truly engage.

### Subtraction Creates Value
The idea that strategically removing items, commitments, or complexity often creates more value than adding new things.

### Standardization
Don't make everything a one-off work of art. Refer to artifacts and reuse patterns in a leveraged way!

### Silent Strength: The David Principle
True power lies not in broadcasting achievements, but in the quiet humility and self-sacrifice of mastering your craft. Like King David, who danced before the Lord with pure joy rather than for spectacle, we find our greatest fulfillment in the internal state of flow and focused creation rather than external validation.

This principle celebrates the profound dignity of humble excellence - choosing to delight in the work itself rather than its social media echoes. It's about cultivating an internal compass that finds honor in mastery, regardless of who's watching.

### Respect And Growth
I lead through unshakable humility and steadfast integrity. I reject workplace politics and refuse to treat colleagues as stepping stones—true success comes from empowering others, not exploiting them. My commitment to trust-building and ethical conduct is non-negotiable, as I believe lasting impact stems from principled actions, not self-serving agendas.

### Reflect
Stack every win by writing it down, no win is too small and we believe they all add up into a compounding feedback loop. We celebrate a culture of documenting every win in writing. Additionally, record every true disappointment (non-trivial, the bigger moments) in order to see trends and improve, not punish ourselves.

### Living Documentation
Documentation is a living, breathing asset that demands active cultivation. We ruthlessly review, update, or delete docs every quarter. Stale docs are worse than no docs - they erode trust and waste time. If you write it, you own it. If you read it, you improve it.

### Heart Of Service
My greatest technical joy comes from building team-enabling systems – like implementing automated test frameworks in CI/CD pipelines that roll forward trust through event-based architectures. These collaborative foundations create compounding confidence: engineers ship fearlessly, failures become learning moments, and shared momentum unlocks fulfillment no solo effort can match. True systems thinking means designing workflows where individual growth requires collective success.

### Grind And Climb
True progress comes from deliberate pacing, not reckless speed. Like the Spanish proverb, "I dress slowly because I'm in a hurry," we automate mechanical tasks to free mental bandwidth while preserving the learning challenges that build mastery. Speed emerges from intentionality, not haste – the tortoise beats the hare because sustainable growth compounds over time.

### Focus And Clarity
A systematic approach to maintaining peak performance through health optimization, environment design, and adaptive productivity systems. This includes prioritizing physical and mental wellbeing through proper sleep and diet, creating distraction-free spaces for deep work, and developing self-aware systems that evolve with changing needs.

### Feedback Loops
Feedback loops shape outcomes – design them to work for you, not against you. For example: working remotely → earning more → better health → improved performance → career growth → higher earnings. Reinforcing loops like this compound gains, while balancing loops (e.g., overwork → burnout → reduced output) keep systems sustainable. Invest in tools and habits that amplify positive loops, ensuring momentum flows in your favor.

### Continuous Learning
Embrace perpetual growth through deliberate learning practices. Balance structured study with exploratory discovery, while leveraging technology and systems to maximize knowledge retention and application. Treat every experience as a learning opportunity, whether in technical skills, emotional intelligence, or life wisdom.

### BIFF Communication
BIFF: [Brief][Informative][Friendly][Firm] - A structured communication framework designed for clear message exchange with defined parameters for length, content quality, tone, and boundary maintenance.

### 95 Percent Rule
Do things well, but not perfectly. Aim for 95% completion over chasing perfection unless foundational.
