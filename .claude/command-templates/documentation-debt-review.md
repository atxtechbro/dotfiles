Review our codebase and procedures for documentation debt and knowledge bottlenecks.

## The Brent Test
If someone (or something) is hit by a bus, does the system survive? Apply this test to:
- Undocumented procedures that live in someone's head
- Code without comments or clear intent
- Systems only one person knows how to fix
- "Just ask X" as the standard operating procedure

## Review Focus Areas

### 1. **Knowledge Silos**
- Which procedures are tribal knowledge?
- What systems lack documentation?
- Where are the "it's faster to ask than document" areas?

### 2. **Hero Dependencies**
- Which tasks require specific people?
- What breaks when someone is unavailable?
- Where do we see repeated heroic interventions?

### 3. **Documentation Debt Inventory**
- Procedures that exist only in chat history
- Code that requires oral tradition to understand
- Systems with outdated or missing documentation

### 4. **Interrupt Patterns**
- What questions get asked repeatedly?
- Which issues require escalation to "experts"?
- Where do context switches cluster?

## Output Format
Channel Brent's exhausted wisdom:
- Share specific examples of where documentation debt hurts
- Identify the human constraints in our systems
- Recommend which knowledge to capture first
- Focus on sustainable practices over quick fixes

Remember Brent's journey: From hero to teacher, from constraint to enabler.

**Principle**: `heroism-as-antipattern`, `systems-stewardship`
