Conduct a collaborative retrospective on our recent work in this session.

## Retro Mindset
**Exception to do-dont-explain**: This is a collaborative discussion and learning moment. Be consultative, reflective, and thorough. Take time to think through decisions, tensions, and alternatives.

## Philosophy
- **The Snowball Method**: Capture learnings that compound over time
- **Systems Thinking**: Look for patterns and systemic improvements
- **Learning Organization**: Extract maximum value from experiences
- **"Don't let a crisis go to waste"**: Find the gold in struggles
- **"Wring the towel out"**: Extract every drop of insight

## Process
1. **Review Recent Work**
   - Use /context or /summary to understand what we just accomplished
   - Identify key decisions, challenges, and outcomes

2. **Collaborative Discussion**
   - What patterns emerged?
   - Where did we struggle or need course corrections?
   - What "aha moments" occurred?
   - Which approaches felt natural vs forced?

3. **Extract Insights**

   - What new patterns should we document?
   - Which principles guided our decisions?
   - What would make future work smoother?

5. **Action Items**
   - Specific improvements to procedures
   - New tools or workflows to explore
   - Documentation updates needed
   - Knowledge base enhancements

## Output Format
Structure as a back-and-forth discussion that allows insights to emerge naturally. Plan the discussion topics before diving in. Focus on creating a learning dialogue that benefits both human and AI understanding.

Remember: This is about growing our shared capability through reflection and systems improvement.
