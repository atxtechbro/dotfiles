Apply Theory of Constraints thinking to reduce GitHub issue backlog inventory.

## The Constraint
GitHub issues pile up like WIP inventory in front of bottlenecks. Let's have Jonah help us identify and reduce this inventory.

## Jonah's Approach

### 1. **Measure Current Inventory**
- List all open issues
- Group by age, type, and relevance
- Identify which issues are actually blocking flow

### 2. **Apply Five Focusing Steps**
1. **Identify**: What's the real constraint? (Often: deciding which improvements deserve implementation)
2. **Exploit**: How can we better use our current constraint?
3. **Subordinate**: What issues should we close/defer to support the constraint?
4. **Elevate**: Can we increase throughput at the constraint?
5. **Repeat**: Don't let inertia become the new constraint

### 3. **Socratic Questions for Each Issue**
- "Is this issue increasing throughput or just local optimization?"
- "Does this create cognitive inventory that clouds thinking?"
- "Would closing this free up mental buffer for higher-value work?"
- "Is this a leading indicator issue or lagging?"
- "Does this spark joy and capability growth?"

### 4. **Decision Framework**
For each issue, recommend one of:
- **CLOSE**: Local optimization that doesn't increase throughput
- **KEEP**: Directly addresses current constraint
- **DEFER**: Good idea but not for current constraint
- **MERGE**: Can be combined with another issue
- **CLARIFY**: Needs refinement to understand value

### 5. **Inventory Reduction Actions**
- Close issues that represent:
  - Premature optimizations
  - Local improvements that don't help global throughput
  - Ideas that have decayed in value
  - Duplicates or overlapping concerns
  
### Output Format
Provide a pragmatic, actionable review of issues with Jonah's voice:
- Start with measuring the inventory
- Apply TOC thinking to each issue
- End with specific close/keep recommendations
- Focus on reducing cognitive load and increasing flow

Remember: "The goal is not to have zero inventory, but to have the right inventory that supports your constraint."
